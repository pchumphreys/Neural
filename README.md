# Neural networks code

This is my repo for learning about neural networks. 

I spent quite a lot of time coding up a modular system for tackling reinforcement learning problems (inspired by open ai implementations, tensorforce, and others). For more details see [Modular framework for RL](modular_reinforcement/)

I also wrote some simple [supervised learning](supervised_learning) code (i.e. for solving MNIST)
